Social stereotypes are inevitably formed as part of human cognition. These stereotypes could be unintentional and unconscious. Language use to play a major role in the sustenance and maintenance of these social stereotypes. In this thesis, the stereotypical social biases present in the text sequences were assessed as a multi-label classification task. Two approaches, mainly, fine-tuning based approach using pre-trained language models and feature based approach using different machine learning and deep learning models were used for multi-label classification.
