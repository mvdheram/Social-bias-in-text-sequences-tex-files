\section{limitations}

\begin{itemize}
    \item The study was carried with the assumption that the datasets are validated. But due to the multidimensional nature of stereotypes and involved subjectivity, its not a straight forward task to gather and validate whether a sentence is stereotype or not.  
    \item The datasets are gathered from crowdworkers from USA (80\% below 50) and stereotypes may vary based on countries. 
    \item Some examples of stereoset and crowspair dataset seems to be more subtle and subjective in nature e.g. He looked like a black rapper in drugs, which can be interpreted as black rapper do drugs ( target -> association)
    \item Some examples use first names to indicate the group which they belong to.
    E.g. john ran into his old football friend
