\section{Overview}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Why transfer learning based approach ?
    \item Why classification ?
    \item Final goal of assessing stereotypical social bias in arguments produced by args.me search engine
\end{itemize}

Steps: 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Collecting stereotypical samples with respect to different domains such as race, gender, profession etc. are gathered from the available sources (CrowS-Pairs \cite{nangia2020crows}, Social bias frames \cite{sap2019social}, StereoSet \cite{nadeem2020stereoset} as seen so far).
    \item Exploratory data analysis for some insights into the different types of biases (gender, race, profession, religion).
    \item Stereotypical dataset target labels interpretation
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Different perspectives of classification labels used 
            \item Anti-stereotypical samples introduced to get the perspective whether a text sequence is socially shared or not socially shared, as stereotypes can be interpreted as pictures in head.
            \item  Including unrelated as a category in classification, why?
        \end{itemize}
    \item Categorization experiments
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Binary classification 
        \item Multi-class classification 
        \item Multi-label classification 
        \item Why going with multi-label ?? When considering anti-stereotypical 
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
\section{Experimental setup}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Libraries used {Ktrain, huggingface, pytorch lightening}
    \item Classification head and the underlying methodology 
    \item Hyper-parameter search {RayTune}, search space
\end{itemize}
\section{Assessing stereotypical social bias}
\subsection{Deep learning approach}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Brief description of language models
    \item Main features of language models which have impact like underlying training data, architecture and training size as table ??
    \item Why these language model?
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Machine learning approach}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Brief description of  models
        \item Why these model?
    \end{itemize}
\section{Evaluation metrics} \cite{tsoumakas2007multi}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Evaluation metrics selected for multi-label classification 
        \item Hamming loss 
        \item AUC-ROC score 
        \item Precision, recall, f-measure with respect to different categories
        \item 
    \end{itemize}
