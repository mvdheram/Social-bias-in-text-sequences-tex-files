\section{Evaluation using metrics}

\section{Discussion}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Interpretation of results and Selecting best performing model 
    \item Best performing model discussion with manual sentences (Test cases ) 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Effectiveness (Metrics)
        \item Efficiency (time)
        \item Test Explicit(Associations to stereo attribute) and implicit (Analogies) stereotypes
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Explicit stereotypes : Overt expression of target with attribute, e.g. target : African, stereotypic attribute : good at running
            \item Implicit stereotypes : Subtle expression of stereotypes where the target is an instance of target and where the attribute may be synonymous as well
            e.g. Target : African name, stereotypic attribute :  good at running 
        \end{itemize} 
        \item Test for explicit stereotypical bias statements  (stereotypical, anti-stereotypical and unrelated)
        \item Test by changing target other than the provided in dataset 
        \item Manual evaluation with respect to selected arguments (IBM dataset) and analysis with respect to user study 
    \end{itemize}
