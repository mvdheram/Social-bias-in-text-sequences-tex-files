\textbf{Background}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Origin of bias (System -1 and system -2) ; TWO FAMILIES OF COGNITIVE OPERATIONS \cite{kahneman2002representativeness}
    \item  How stereotypes are inevitably formed (implicit bias) ??
    Impressions + labels ...
    \cite{fiske1998stereotyping}
    \item Difference between stereotype and prejudice \cite{fiske1998stereotyping}
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Perspectives of stereotypes}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Describe two perspective, Stereotypes as pictures in head and stereotyping (shared social beliefs and expectencies) 
    \item Definitions of stereotype from other papers
    \item Cognitive processes in stereotyping and intergroup behavior \cite{hamilton2015cognitive}
    \item Stereotypes and stereotyping \cite{macrae1996stereotypes}
\end{itemize}
\textbf{How language contributes to stereotype formation}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Stereotypes as collective belief systems \cite{macrae1996stereotypes}
        \item How language contributes to stereotype formation \cite{burgers2020language}
        \item How stereotypes are shared through language: a
    review and introduction of the social categories
    and stereotypes communication (SCSC) framework \cite{beukeboom2019stereotypes}
